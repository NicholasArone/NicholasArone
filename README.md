### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Nicholas Arone, a student at Southwest CTA.
### I'm interested in digital game development so I can learn more about programming as a whole, let alone programming video games. 
### As of now, my highest interest in the field of digital game development is local and/or online multiplayer games.
